# Essenciale Manaus Website

This repo contains a business website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org). See it live at [essencialemanaus.com.br](http://essencialemanaus.com.br)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
* [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
